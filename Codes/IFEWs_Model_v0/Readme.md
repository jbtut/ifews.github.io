# Code details:
This code takes input variables and compute CN, MN, FN, GN, and nitrogen surplus in soil

Input variables:  
 y_c   =  Corn yield (busheles/acres)   
 y_s   =  Soy yield (busheles/acres)   
 RCN_c = Rate of commercial N (Corn) kg/ha  
 RCN_s = Rate of commercial N (Soy) kg/ha  
 Hog   = Hogs/pigs population  
 CAtt_B = Beef cattle population  
 CAtt_M = Milk cattle population  
 CAtt_O = Other cattle population  
 
Output: Nitrogen surplus in soil (kg/ha) annual
